Web Page Project – HTML & CSS from Scratch
Project Overview
This project is a hands-on exercise in building a complete, fully functional web page from scratch, without using any external libraries or frameworks. It focuses on applying core concepts in HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive web design.

The goal is to recreate a designer-provided layout as closely as possible using clean, semantic HTML and well-structured CSS.

What I Learned
Structuring content using semantic HTML5 elements

Styling with modern CSS: Flexbox, gradients, spacing, typography

Improving accessibility by using proper tags, attributes, and contrast

Debugging layout and design issues for cross-device compatibility

Project Features
