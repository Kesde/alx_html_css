My CSS Fundamentals Project
Welcome to my CSS Fundamentals project! This project helps me practice how to use CSS to style web pages. It’s built with HTML and CSS, and lays the foundation for creating beautiful websites.
Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I’m able to explain and demonstrate:
What is CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It controls how HTML elements look.
How to add style to an element
I can use inline styles, internal styles (<style>), and external stylesheets (linked .css file).
What is a class
A class is a reusable label that lets me style multiple elements the same way.
Example: <p class="highlight">...</p>
What is a selector
Selectors target HTML elements for styling (e.g., p, .highlight, #main-header).
How to compute CSS Specificity Value
I understand specificity is the rule for which style gets applied if there are conflicting rules.
What are Box properties in CSS
The box model includes:
•	width/height: content size
•	padding: inside spacing
•	border: box edge
•	margin: outside spacing
How the browser loads a webpage
Browsers parse HTML, then load CSS and apply styles to display the webpage.
How to View My Project
1.	Clone/download this repository to your computer.
2.	Open index.html in your browser.
3.	Check styles.css to see how I used CSS.
Tools Used
•	Visual Studio Code (recommended editor)
•	HTML5 & CSS3 for structure and styling
•	W3C Validator to ensure valid code
Key Takeaways
•	I can create well-structured HTML pages and style them with CSS.
•	I know how to use classes, selectors, and the box model.
•	I’m ready to explore more advanced topics like responsive design and JavaScript.
This version should fit comfortably on a single page in Word, while still retaining all essential information and a clean, structured style. Let me know if you’d like me to adjust margins, font size, or style for the final document.
